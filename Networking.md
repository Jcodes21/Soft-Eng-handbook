The internet is a network of networks connecting billions of devices allowing them to communicate and share data.

MAC address
The Media Access Control address is a hardware identifier hardcoded to a devices Network Interface Card NIC or equivalent network chip.
A mac address is 48 bits (6 bytes) and usually looks like this:
A4:5D:36:90:12:BB.
The first 3 bytes are know as the Organisation Unique Identifier, OUI.
The last 3 bytes are assigned by the manufacturer and used to uniquely identify each device.

The Address Resolution Protocol ARP resolves an IP address to its correspondong MAC address.

IP
The internet protocol defines how devices communicate and route data over a network.
A router assigns devices joins the network with their IP address. Each device is assigned either a static (fixed) or dynamic IP address. 
Static IPs are manually set and do not change. This is useful for macines that need a constant address i.e. servers and printers
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, DHCP assigns dynamic addresses to devices joining the network ehich last a set period of time (known as a lease)


IPv4
IPv4 addresses are 32 bytes since they are made up of 4 octets, 8 bytes each.
192.168.1.0

IPv6
v6 addresses were created to overcome the limited address capacity of IPv4 and to support the growing number of internet connected devices.



Transmission Control Protocol - TCP
Connection oriented. Sender and reciever must first establish connection with a 3 way handshake.
SYN
ACK


Fast recovery
TCP Tahoe
TCP Reno


User Datagram Protocol - UDP
Connectionless, no handshake needed to establish connection.


OSI model
-------------
The OSI model is a conceptual framework for understanding computer networking.


Physical layer 
Raw bit stream (1s 0s) over physical medium such as cables.

Data link Layer - MAC

Network layer - IP

Transmission Layer - TCP

Session layer 
Connection management 

Presentation Layer
Data formatting and encryption 

Application Layer
user facing services
