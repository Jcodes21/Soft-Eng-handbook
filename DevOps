Dev ops
========

DevOps is a mindset and set of practices. It started as a cultural movement in 2007.

It was inspired by frustrations between dev and ops teams not working effectiently together.
Before Devops programmers would "throw code over the wall" to the operations teams who would deploy and maintain it.

The purpose of DevOps is to sgorten the development lifecycle and improve collaboration, reliability and delivery speed through automation.

A pipeline is an automated sequence of steps that builds, tests and deploys code from development to production.

Ci/CD are the two core pillars of DevOps.

Continuous Integration CI
A software development practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository.


Continous Delivery/Deployment CD
Delivery - Code is atomatically prepared for release.

Deployment - The automatic release of code into production after each change passes the necessary tests.
