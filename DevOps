Dev ops
========

DevOps is a mindset and set of practices. It started as a cultural movement in 2007.

It was inspired by frustrations between dev and ops teams not working effectiently together.
Before Devops programmers would "throw code over the wall" to the operations teams who would deploy and maintain it.


Ci/CD are the two core pillars of DevOps.

Continuous Integration CI
A software development practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository.


Continous Delivery/Deployment CD
Delivery - Automatically prepared code for release.


Deployment - automatic release of code into production after each change passes the necessary tests.
